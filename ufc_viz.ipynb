I haven't explored the data provided before, so this is my first time doing so. I dove into the data set [(link)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danmcinerney/mma-differentials-and-elo?rvi=1) provided and we can see trends based on fighters, their wins and losses, different divisions, and the method of winning or losing."

Using a line plot was also an option, but when selecting wins or loss or both, it didn't really make sense to me at the time of constructing this visualization. \n",

On initialization you may realize that some points may overlay on each other, which means that the fights took place on the same day and the fighters had similar performance metrics in their fights. In this visualization the X-axis will always be the date since it didn't make sense to use any other data type since the goal is show fighter improvement/comparison. The Y-axis will be the up to the user to select "

Bokeh is maintained on GitHub and is recommended if a user finds a bug to report it to the GitHub for developers to fix. [website](https://bokeh.org/)\n",

I didn't choose Altair/Vega due to my previous experience with in is 522. Another plus that I saw to Bokeh is that I could practice JavaScript/CSS, but I only used it in one line in this project. In future projects, I think a more complex dashboard would require more of these languages.\n",

There is a caveat though, this is a low level version of the bokeh.scatter, but offers more customizability by changing the shape, and we can pass through arguments for different colors on different data points."

Time formats are based on the current UFC ruling where main events and championship fights are 5 rounds, and all other are 3 rounds. Before the UFC adopted this rule there were a multitude of different time formats, some of them unsafe like a no time limit. I chose to omit all other time formats that are not 3 or 5 rounds due to transfering this knowledge into the modern day and not some arbitrary time."
